# Reqres.in API Automation Testing with Java and Selenide üöÄ

Welcome to the **Reqres.in API Automation Testing Project**! This repository demonstrates how to automate API testing for [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) using **Java** and **Selenide**. Developed as part of the QA.GURU educational platform, this project showcases best practices in API testing, including test structure, reporting, and maintainability.

---

## üìù Introduction

This project is designed for:
- Practicing API automation testing techniques.
- Understanding how to structure and execute API tests with modern tools.
- Gaining hands-on experience with **Selenide**, **REST Assured**, and other key technologies.

The testing scope includes verifying various RESTful API endpoints provided by Reqres.in for functionalities like user management, registration, and delayed responses.

## üß™ Test Cases

### Covered Scenarios:
1. **GET Endpoints**:
   - Validate user data retrieval.
   - Test single and multiple user queries.
   - Validate error scenarios for non-existing users.

2. **POST Endpoints**:
   - Validate user creation.
   - Verify response payload and status codes.
   - Test unsuccessful registration and login attempts.

3. **PUT Endpoints**:
   - Validate user updates.

4. **DELETE Endpoints**:
   - Test user deletion and confirm appropriate responses.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test invalid inputs and boundary conditions.
   - Validate server handling of large payloads.
